# Occupansee

An app to help you see the current occupancy of your favorite stores before heading out the door. 

## Description

This app was imagined in the height of all the stores having an occupancy state requirement during the 2020 Pandemic. The thought behind it was to create an app that would allow you to see the current occupancy of a business so you can avoid standing in lines outside of your favorite stores. 

Currently the app is set to only show one business as an example of the potential it has. There are multiple updates planned, one of which includes connecting to yelp API to find stores near you.
